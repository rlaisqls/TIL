Consider an organization the built a hub-and-spoke network with AWS Transit Gateway. VPCs have been provisoned into multiple AWS accounts, perhaps to facilitate network isolation or to enable delegated network administration. When deploying distributed architectures such as this, a popular approach is to build a "shared servicecs VPC, which provides access to service required by workloads in each of the VPCs. This might include directory services or VPC endpoints. Sharing resources from a central location instread of building them in each VPC may reduce administrative overhead and cost."
