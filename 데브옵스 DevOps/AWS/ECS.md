# ECS

Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a fully managed container orchestration service that helps you easily deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications. As a fully managed service, Amazon ECS comes with AWS configuration and operational best practices built-in. It's integrated with both AWS and third-party tools, such as Amazon Elastic Container Registry and Docker. This integration makes it easier for teams to focus on building the applications, not the environment. You can run and scale your container workloads across AWS Regions in the cloud, and on-premises, without the complexity of managing a control plane.

## Amazon ECS terminology and components

There are three layers in Amazon ECS:

Capacity - The infrastructure where your containers run

Controller - Deploy and manage your applications that run on the containers

Provisioning - The tools that you can use to interface with the scheduler to deploy and manage your applications and containers

The following diagram shows the Amazon ECS layers.
