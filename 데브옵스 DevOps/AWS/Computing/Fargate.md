# Fargate

- Fargate is a servreless compute engine for containers.

- The Fargate launch type allows you to run your containerized applications without the need to procision and manage the backend infrastructure. Just register your task definition and Fargate launches the container for you.

- It works with both Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)
  
- Fargate makes it easy for you to focus on building your applications. It removes the need to procision and manage servers, lets you specify and pay for resources per application, and improves security through application isolation by design.
