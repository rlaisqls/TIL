# Spotâ€…Block

Spot blocks are designed not to be interrupted and will run continuously for the duration you select, independent of Spot market price.

In rare situations, Spot blocks may be interrupted due to Amazon Web Services capacity needs. In these cases, we will provide a two-minute warning before we terminate your instance, and you will not be charged for the affected instance(s).
