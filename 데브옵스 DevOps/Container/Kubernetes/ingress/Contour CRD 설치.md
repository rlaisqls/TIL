- Install Contour:
    - Use the appropriate command for your cluster manager to install Contour. For example, using kubectl for Kubernetes:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://projectcontour.io/quickstart/contour.yaml
```
    - This command downloads and applies the Contour manifest file, which includes the necessary resources for Contour's installation.

- Verify Contour installation:

    - Check that the Contour resources are running and ready:
  
```bash
kubectl get pods -n projectcontour
```

    - Ensure that all the Contour pods are in a running state.

- Install the HTTPProxy resource:

    - Download and apply the HTTPProxy CRD manifest:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://projectcontour.io/quickstart/http-proxy.yaml
```

  - This manifest installs the HTTPProxy CRD, which enables you to define HTTP routing rules using the HTTPProxy resource.

- Verify HTTPProxy installation:

    - Check that the HTTPProxy CRD is successfully installed:

```bash
kubectl get crd
```

Look for projectcontour.io/HTTPProxy in the list of available CRDs.
Once you have completed these steps, you should have Project Contour installed with the HTTPProxy resource available for use. You can now create HTTPProxy objects to define your HTTP routing rules and configure your application's ingress behavior.
