# IPAM

**IP Address Management (IPAM)** is an integrated suite of tools to enable end-to-end planning, deploying, managing and monitoring of your IP address infrastructure, with a rich user experience. IPAM automatically discovers IP address infrastructure servers and Domain Name System (DNS) servers on your network and enables you to manage them from a central interface.

IPAM brings a centralized repository used to build an inventory of the networks, subnets and IP addresses (private and public). It allows administrators to maintain accurate and current records of IP assignments and available addresses. Typical records are:

- Free/assigned IP address space
- Status of each IP address
- Hostname associated with each IP address
- Hardware associated with each IP address
- Size of subnets and current users

## Key Benefits

1. Easier administration
   - for delegation of address space management; improved visibility over IP resources cross-platforms; automation of DNS-DHCP configurations and automatic real-time updates when a host connects/disconnects from TCP/IP network (if the IPAM is integrated with DNS and DHCP servers); built-in reports.
  
2. Enhanced reliability
   - lower risk of misconfigurations by avoiding overlapping subnets and duplicate IP addresses, and by enforcing FQDN; reduced network service downtime; faster troubleshooting.
  
3. Reduced complexity
   - single centralized repository containing IP Golden Records; address space related information fetched from RIR and maintained in IPAM; single interface/tool for the administrator to manage both private and public address plans; network discovery to gather info about hosts connected, VRFs etc.; IPv6 management capability.

4. Ensured integrity
   - integration with DNS/DHCP/RIR allows IPAM to be updated with “A” Resource Records and lease information; policy rules can be enforced.
