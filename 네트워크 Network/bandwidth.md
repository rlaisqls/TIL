# bandwidth

Bandwidth is a measure of how much information a network, a group of two or more devices that communicate between themselves, can transfer. Data moves from A to B just as water flows through pipes from a supply point to our faucets. The volume that's transported varies, impacting how effectively a transmission medium, such as an internet connection, operates.

Internet service providers (ISPs) typically denote bandwidth speeds in millions of bits per second (Bps), or megabits (Mbps), and billions of Bps, or gigabits (Gbps). Generally speaking, the higher the bandwidth, the quicker a device downloads information from the internet, including emails or streamed movies.
