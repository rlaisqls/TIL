> Bandwidth is the amount of data that can be transmitted in a specified amount of time.

Bandwidth is a measure of how much information a network, a group of two or more devices that communicate between themselves, can transfer. Data moves from A to B just as water flows through pipes from a supply point to our faucets. The volume that's transported varies, impacting how effectively a transmission medium, such as an internet connection, operates.

Internet service providers (ISPs) typically denote bandwidth speeds in millions of bits per second (Bps), or megabits (Mbps), and billions of Bps, or gigabits (Gbps). Generally speaking, the higher the bandwidth, the quicker a device downloads information from the internet, including emails or streamed movies.

### Recording Bandwidth

Any device can measure the bandwidth it has at any given time. Special websites or the Internet Service Provider can calculate the bandwidth by sending a file through the connection and then waiting for the information to return.

### Bandwidth Requirements

The amount of bandwidth required to surf the web seamlessly depends on the task the user wishes to undertake.

For instance, an instant messaging conversation may use 1,000 bits, or one kilobit, per second in bandwidth. A voice-over internet conversation, in which someone's voice transmits through internet connections, typically uses more than 1 Mbps to 3 megabits per second.

Moving further up the scale, standard-definition video takes 1 Mbps, while 4k needs at least 15 Mbps. The highest available, 8k, requires speeds of nearly 100 Mbps for seamless viewing.

### What Is a Good Bandwidth?

A good bandwidth allows you to transmit and receive the amount of data you need without overloading your connection's capacity. A medium business might require at least 25 Mbps down and 3 Mbps up speeds, while a smaller business could use less. However, the faster your bandwidth is, the better it is for you and your customers.
