Telemetry automatically **collects**, **transmits** **and measures data from remote sources**, using sensors and other devices to collect data. It uses communication systems to transmit the data back to a central location. Subsequently, the data is analyzed to monitor and control the remote system.

Collecting telemetry data is essential for administering and managing various IT infrastructres. This data is used to monotor the performance of different systems and provide actionable insight. Telemetry data helps improve customer experiences and monitor security, application health, quality and performance.

## Key takeaways

- Collecting telemetry data is essential for administering and managing varius IP infrastructures.
- Measure telemetry through monitoring tools, which measure everything from server performance to utilization.
- If a hacking attempt or security breach occurs, holisting monitoring helps you determine if critical data was lost or stolen or if systems are compromised.
- A telemetry software vendor helps implement a sound monitoring strategy and ensures that it evolves and becomes more comprehensive over time.

## How Does Telemetry Work?

Telemetry for application monitoring is a four-step process:

### 1. Specifying the Metrics

This step involves **planning how the telemetry is going to take place**. Metrics are specified for the developer’s process to track to get the performance of their application. The developers need to place a plan of action that if the given hypothesis is validated, what should be happening. It helps prioritize the work.

Then the developer needs to **specify the lifetime of the telemetric run**. It depends on the cost and returns on the investment of the run. Once you have specified the life, you will give the formula the telemetrics would calculate. The developer needs to mention the necessary data points here.

### 2. Data Transmission 

Telemetry requires **keeping track** of the user’s activity on your application. That makes it important for the developer to stay aware of the privacy laws and regulations. For that purpose, the best course of action is to get the end-user to sign up for telemetry data analysis.

To make the process safe and secure, you must also **ensure that data transmission and safety**. It should not be able to easily fall into the hands of hackers or any third-party users. In some situations, when the device is connected to a metered network, it may incur charges. That is why it is better to wait until the device is connected to an unmetered connection.

### 3. Data Processing

Once the data is transmitted and stored, it needs to be **processed before it can be used**. For that purpose, various mathematical formulas are run to make data digestible for the analysis. The method adopted for the data processing may depend upon the type of metrics set by the developer.

For the type of metrics that involve a formula, the step is mainly to apply the data to simplify the results. If required, the results are merged with other data sets. For exploratory metrics, a data mining approach is adopted. In this method, computer algorithms are run to find the hidden pattern in the data.

### 4. Data Analysis

The final step of the telemetric process is to perform the analysis of the data. Once the data has been collected and filtered into their respective data sets, the data is analyzed to see the performance of the software. In this step, all the issues and bugs with the application are reported and rectified by the developer. 

Once the developer implements the action plan, the identified problem is removed from the application. It helps improve the user experience of the application making it better and easier for the user.
